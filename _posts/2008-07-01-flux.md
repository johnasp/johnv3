#### Overview

Website for the small (very small, just me!) I created to but a more professional facade over the freelance projects I was doing on the side at the time.  I decided to can it in the end and just use my own name and website for freelance jobs in the future.  The site I built looked nice though and was built with a series of PHP includes as was pre-Wordpress et al.   


The site is longer live as it was time based but can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120126131056/http://www.fluxcreate.co.uk/">viewed here</a> on the WayBack Machine internet archive.
