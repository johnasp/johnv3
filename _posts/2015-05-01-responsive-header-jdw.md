#### Overview

The client was in the process of exploring the possible conversion of it's suite of adaptive (mobile-tablet-desktop) websites into a single responsive site.  

As I had <a href="kleeneze">previous experience</a> of building responsive websites from the ground up, I was asked to build a fully functioning prototype of the site header.  The website header was picked as this was deemed to be the most complex, problematic and important part of the site as it contained the site's main navigation navigation. 

The company wanted to see how it performed live on devices so I decided the best way to achieve this was to build a fully functioning prototype in the browser.

#### What I did 

I coded the prototype direct in the browser using HTML, CSS, SASS and Jquery.  You can inspect the code I wrote in the <a href="https://github.com/johnasp/ecommerce_responsive_header">Github repo</a> I created for the prototype and can view it direct in your browser of choice by clicking the image below: 

<div class="no-margin"><a href="http://johnasp.github.io/ecommerce_responsive_header/"><img src="/img/jdw-responsive-header-home.jpg" alt="Responsive ecommerce header" /></a></div>
