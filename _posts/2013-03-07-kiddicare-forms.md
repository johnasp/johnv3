#### Overview

The client was developing a mobile application for it's e-commerce store and I was tasked with designing the front end login and registration forms.  

This was only a small piece of work but was quite a useful exercise learning nonetheless, as this was a standalone piece of code to write, it allowed me to put the new SASS and Compass framework skills I had been learning, into practice.
