#### Overview

View Traffic a website for locating traffic cameras throughout the UK.  I was tasked with designing a building the site in a way in which the site owner could maintain the content, in addition to being able to add new traffic cameras.

I built the site using Wordpress as the backend CMS and created a cusom theme.  I also performed some SEO work on the site a later date which yielded a considerable ROI for the work as ad click through rates increased by a considerable margin.

### Update

This website was bought out by a competitor and the site own made a decent return on his intial investment.  The site was incororated into a new site by its new owner and is no longer live although you can view select pages from the site using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100828152840/http://www.viewtraffic.info/">WayBack Machine</a> internet archive.
