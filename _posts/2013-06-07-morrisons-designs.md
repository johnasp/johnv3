#### Overview

I was brought in to the Morrisons Digital team in Manchester as an innovation UX developer and as I had previous digital design experience, I was asked as part of this role to design some concepts for the new Morrisons.com website. 

The designs I created were well received by the digital team and also at the head office in Bradford.  The designs were unfortunately never put into production (along with a lot of other work completed by the team) as the company decided to follow another development path following the acquisition of Ocado and used their platform. 

I have unfortunately misplaced the full set of concepts, although I do have the homepage which can be viewed in full screen by clicking the image below:
