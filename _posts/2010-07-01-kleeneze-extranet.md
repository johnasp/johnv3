#### Overview

Converted the existing distributor website from a static, file based HTML system into a dynamic, CMS solution powered by Wordpress.  Created a child theme out of an existing theme and customised the new child theme. 

The HTML site was a nightmare to update (I know this as I was in charge of all content updates!) and this new system reduced a massive content update bottleneck as it allowed each department in the organisation to update their own content.  

My Wordpress solution also saved the company money to the tune of Â£100K+ as an external contractor was trying to get the company to invest in IBM Websphere to essentially just be used a CMS.  My 'free' Wordpress implementation saved the company a forthune in both licence and consultancy fees which was something I was quite proud of....in addition to save my sanity as I know longer had to update the site content!
