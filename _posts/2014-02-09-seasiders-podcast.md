#### Overview

A responsive website I built from scratch to delivery the podcast content I produced for a show I created about Blackpool FC.  This was third iteration of the site design for the podcast I started in 2010.  The initial site I built was fixed width and I was soon getting request for a site which was mobile friendly so I decided to redesign the site into a responsive one.

I also read a great book called SASS and Compass by Ben Frain before I performed this site redesign which also provided me with a great insight as to what can be achieved with CSS pre-processors and CSS Frameworks. 

I was keen to learn SASS and how to build a repsonsove site from the ground up and so purchased and followed this excellent tutorial from Chris Coyier of CSS Tricks and how to build a repsonsive site from the bottom up with SASS.  I found this course invaluable in my learnings as in addition to responsive and SASS, it also taught me a great deal of techniques of how to approach a content heavy site redesign.  

#### What I did

1. Performed a content taxonomy to classify and order all my video, audio and blog content
2. Did rough site page designs in Fireworks
3. Coded the site with a mobile first approach using SASS & Compass
4. Converted the site to a Wordpress theme and setup Wordpress installation
