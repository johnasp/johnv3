#### Overview

Kiddicare are a multi-channel retailer specialising in baby products who Morrisons acquired in 2014.  I was placed as UX lead on a project to convert and re-design the existing Kiddicare website into a responsive/adaptive site.

#### Prototype

The proposed design for the layout of the new homepage involved a complicated product grid (similar to Pinterest) which was should display product screen elements of different sizes of rectangle.

The behaviour of this layout grid, particularly at different screen sizes, was proving difficult to convey to stakeholders in static wireframe form.  To resolve this problem, I decided to build a <a href="/protos/kiddicare/demo.html">working HTML prototype of the homepage</a> and demonstrate this direct in a web browser.  This readily helped in stakeholder understanding of the interface and helped in achieving sign off at this stage. 

I built the prototype using the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> framework and my demo can be viewed by here <a href="/protos/kiddicare/demo.html">clicking this link</a>.

#### Visual Design

I was responsible for producing visual design concepts for the look and feel of the new website, examples of which can be seen below.  

NB - Click the images below to look at an enlarged view of each screen. 

#### Wireframes

Working in conjunction with a business analyst, I produced wireframes of all  key screens at mobile, tablet and desktop views, and also created click-able regions in order that a sample user journey could be followed in a  demonstration.

I also exported the screens as JPGâ€™s which I pinned to the walls of project design meeting, the purpose of which to encourage collaborative iterations of the positioning, prominence and inclusion of screen elements.  

Samples of the wireframes I produced can be seen by viewing the gallery below:
