## Project overview

Complete ground up build of the new JDWilliams USA website using the Hybris platform at the back end. My involvement in this project was a front end designer and developer (as part of a team) to build out responsive template components of the site.  My focus was on building the mobile components including the off canvas menus, product size guide, product list and product detail pages.  I approached this work with the "mobile first" philosophy. 

I was directly responsible for designing concepts and writing the front end code HTML, CSS, Jquery and LESS for the aforementioned templates.
